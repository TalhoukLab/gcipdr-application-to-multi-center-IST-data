This is code to run an applicatoin of the 'gcipdr' package (see omonimous repository) on the open multi-center International Stroke Trial (IST) data. 

# Instructions

Simply clone or download the repository. The main analysis is in file 'gcipdr_IST_analysis.R'. Just execute the whole script. 
Additional simulations are in 'sim_1.R' and 'sim_2.R' (simulations on aspirin and blood-pressure effect respectively). Run these scripts separately. 
Files depend on 'simulation_functions_v9.R'. Beware: changing number of cores can yield different results. Computation time in the simulation study can take up to several hours under current settings.
